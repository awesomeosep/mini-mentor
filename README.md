## How We Built It
**Frontend**:
- Next.js
- React
- shadcn/ui
- Tailwind CSS
  
**Backend**:
- Supabase
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js
- Next.js

We initially wanted to create this project using a Python backend, since we were all familiar with Python, but it ended up beign much more difficult, so we switched to Nextjs. We also encountered challenges building the backend APIs, since much of that was new to our team.
